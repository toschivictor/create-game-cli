# Create Game CLI

A command-line tool to quickly scaffold Pixi.js game projects with TypeScript, Vite, and modern development tools.

## Features

- **Multiple Templates**: Choose from Basic, Platformer, or Top-Down game templates
- **TypeScript Support**: Full TypeScript configuration with strict mode
- **Vite Integration**: Fast development server and optimized builds
- **Code Quality**: Pre-configured with Biome for linting and formatting
- **Modern Tooling**: Uses latest versions of Pixi.js and development tools
- **Ready to Run**: Generated projects work immediately with `npm run dev`

## Installation

### Global Installation (Recommended)

```bash
npm install -g create-game-cli
```

### Local Development

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd create-game-cli
npm install
npm run build
npm link
```

## Usage

### Interactive Mode

Simply run the command and follow the prompts:

```bash
create-game
```

The CLI will ask you for:
- Project name
- Template type (Basic, Platformer, or Top-Down)
- Target directory
- Whether to initialize git repository
- Whether to install dependencies

### Example

```bash
$ create-game
ðŸŽ® Create Game CLI

âœ” What is your project name? â€¦ my-awesome-game
âœ” Choose a project template: â€º Basic Game
âœ” Where should we create your project? â€¦ ./my-awesome-game
âœ” Initialize git repository? â€¦ yes
âœ” Install dependencies? â€¦ yes

ðŸŽ‰ Your game project is ready!

Next steps:
  cd my-awesome-game
  npm run dev

Happy coding! ðŸš€
```

## Templates

### Basic Game
- Simple game setup with a moveable green square
- Basic input handling (WASD/Arrow keys)
- Good starting point for any type of game

### Platformer
- Physics-based movement with gravity and jumping
- Platform collision detection
- Blue character that can jump on platforms
- Controls: A/D for movement, W/Up/Space for jumping

### Top-Down
- 8-directional movement with smooth rotation
- Obstacle collision detection
- Red triangle character that rotates to face movement direction
- Controls: WASD/Arrow keys for movement

## Development Commands

After creating a project, you can use these commands:

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview

# Format code
npm run format

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Check and fix code quality issues
npm run check
```

## Generated Projects
- **Pixi.js**: High-performance 2D rendering engine
- **TypeScript**: Type safety for game development
- **Vite**: Fast development server and build tool
- **Biome**: Consistent code style and quality
