# Create Game CLI

A command-line tool to quickly scaffold Pixi.js game projects with TypeScript, Vite, and modern development tools.

## Features

- **Multiple Templates**: Choose from Basic, Platformer, or Top-Down game templates
- **TypeScript Support**: Full TypeScript configuration with strict mode
- **Vite Integration**: Fast development server and optimized builds
- **Code Quality**: Pre-configured with Biome for linting and formatting
- **Modern Tooling**: Uses latest versions of Pixi.js and development tools
- **Ready to Run**: Generated projects work immediately with `npm run dev`

## Installation

### Global Installation (Recommended)

```bash
npm install -g create-game-cli
```

### Local Development

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd create-game-cli
npm install
npm run build
npm link
```

## Usage

### Interactive Mode

Simply run the command and follow the prompts:

```bash
create-game
```

The CLI will ask you for:
- Project name
- Template type (Basic, Platformer, or Top-Down)
- Target directory
- Whether to initialize git repository
- Whether to install dependencies

### Example

```bash
$ create-game
ðŸŽ® Create Game CLI

âœ” What is your project name? â€¦ my-awesome-game
âœ” Choose a project template: â€º Basic Game
âœ” Where should we create your project? â€¦ ./my-awesome-game
âœ” Initialize git repository? â€¦ yes
âœ” Install dependencies? â€¦ yes

ðŸŽ‰ Your game project is ready!

Next steps:
  cd my-awesome-game
  npm run dev

Happy coding! ðŸš€
